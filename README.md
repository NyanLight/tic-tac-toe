# Tic-Tac-Toe: Hello Kitty edition

Hi! It's my **'Tic-Tac-Toe: Hello Kitty edition'** game for **The Odin Project**, so I should say that the main purpose of this game is to improve my comprehension of module patters, IIFE etc. 

## There are key features: 
* Custom nicknames
* Pretty themed icons instead of mundane crosses and noughts
* The score is displayed right above the field
* No global variables
